## 🚀 Introduction: Why This Guide Matters in 2025

In 2025, electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer just for early adopters—they’re becoming the standard. With EVs now making up nearly **25% of global new car sales** ([IEA, 2024](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024)), improved model availability, expanding infrastructure, and generous incentives, there's never been a better time to switch from gas to electric.

But with more choices come more questions. Should you buy a fully electric car (BEV) or a plug-in hybrid (PHEV)? What about range, charging, battery warranties, and resale value?

This guide is your one-stop resource to confidently navigate your EV purchase in 2025.
